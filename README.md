# Project Description:

Parabank is a virtual banking application used for simulating and testing financial transactions. It is not a real financial institution, but it can be utilized like a real banking application during software testing processes.

The listed testing environments are designed for performing various transactions that users can execute in a web-based banking application. They are essential tools for simulating financial activities such as account opening, money transfers, applying for loans, and bill payments. These environments facilitate the implementation of different test scenarios.
